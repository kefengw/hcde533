            <p>This is the final outcome of my work: <a href="https://www.burjkhalifa.ae/en/the-tower/facts-figures/">Burj Khalifa</a> in the Mill.</p>

                There are 16 pieces of each type. The longer strips are 3.93 inches long(10cm) and 0.78 inches long (2cm).<br>
                And the round pieces are 2.48 inches in radius. Each component has 4 notches. The notches are 3mm in<br>
                width and 6mm in depth. They could help to connect pieces together.

                I measured the thickness of the cardboard I would use to cut. That is the reason why I specially set <br>
                the width of notches to 3 mm.

            <p>Based on the size of this cardboard, I have created the layout for my print plan in AI.</p>

                I borrowed laptops from the Mill and used Adobe AI for printing. It was really difficult at first when I was <br>
                 trying to change the starting point to the concern of my cardboard.
