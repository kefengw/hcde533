                there are 16 pieces of each type. The longer strips are 3.93 inches long(10cm) and 0.78 inch long (2cm). <br>
                And the round pieces are 2.48 inches in radius. Each component has 4 notches. The notches are 3mm in <br>
                width and 6mm in depth. They could help to connect pieces together.

                I have measureed the thickness of the cardboard I would use to cut. That is the reason why I specially set <br>
                the width of notches to 3 mm.
