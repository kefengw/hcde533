                Before I start my documentation, I want to give credit to <b>Kyle Wang</b>, who helped me figure out how to create a 3D model for the silicon <b>mold and further casting</b>. The item I want to get from the molding and casting is shown below. And it would be used for my final project design.

            <h2>Design the 3D printing Mold</h2>
            <p>
                I started this assignment by building the silicon mold around my final out.  The first step I take is to create a silicon mold around it. This step could be split into four small tasks:<br>
                1. Create the Hexagonal column in the middle of my mold. <br>
                2. Create the cube and make one big hole in the middle for the main part. <br>
                3. Adding four keys on each corner. <br>
                4. Adding the tube for injection of the hydro stone. <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                The second step is to build a 3D model to get the mold. This step is relatively easier than the previous step. I used the "boolean difference." 
                to subtract the mold I created from a cube.  
            </p>

                the 3D printing takes 2h and 20+ mins.

            <h2>Creating the silicon mold</h2>
            <p>
                Well, the process of using Oomoo is definitely easier than the process of making hydro-stone.
                 My 3D model is very small, as shown in the previous image. I only use one shot of each Oomoo and mix these two liquids together. 
            </p>

            <p>
                After 6 hours of waiting, I peeled the 3D model and finally got my mold. 
                During this process, I questioned myself why I made my 3D model in a whole piece since it was very difficult to take the mold out.

            <h2>Hydrostone </h2>
            <p>
                After doing a little bit of research, I thought it takes hours for hydrostone to dry. But it actually only took several minutes. 
                I only left a hole with a 5mm diameter to inject the hydrostone into the mold. So in order to do that, I purchased a syringe from
                CVS. However, that is <b>not a good idea</b>. 
            </p>
            <img src="images/A6-hydrostoneInjection.jpeg" width="800">
            <p>
                Because the hydrostone dries up so quickly, so the hydrostone that was left at the bottom dried up in 5 mins.
                 So I could continue using the syringe to inject more hydrostone. 
                 But the liquid hydrodstone is very stringy, so it was hard to pull into a small hole. 
                 So I cut my mold to make the hole bigger for future use. The image below is my final outcome from the mold made by hydrostone.
