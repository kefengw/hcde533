                Before I start my documentation, I want to give credit to <b>Kyle Wang</b>, who helped me figure out how to create a 3D model for the silicon <b>mold and further casting</b>. The item I want to get from the molding and casting is shown below. And it would be used for my final project design.

                I started this assignment by building the silicon mold around my final out.  The first step I take is to create a silicon mold around it. This step could be split into four small tasks:<br>
                1. Create the Hexagonal column in the middle of my mold. <br>
                2. Create the cube and make one big hole in the middle for the main part. <br>
                3. Adding four keys on each corner. <br>
                4. Adding the tube for injection of the hydro stone. <br>
            </p>

                The second step is to build a 3D model to get the mold. This step is relatively easier than the previous step. I used the "boolean difference." 
                to subtract the mold I created from a cube.

                the 3D printing takes 2h and 20+ mins.
