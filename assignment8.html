            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>
                What I want to make is a shredder as a Christmas gift for my friend. The video shown below is where I found my insights. Ideally, the shredder should be able to cut paper into
                pieces easily.

            <h2>3D Design in Rhino and Printing</h2>
            <img src="images/a8-finalOutcomeW.png" alt="" width="800">
            <p>
                My design has five major parts: a Funnel, an Upper Case, two sets of blades, and stand. In total, there are 20 pieces for the whole shredder. 5 blades are <b>Laser Cut</b> of the Acrylic board. Only one blade is <b>3D printed</b>.<br><br>
                There are six spaces in the innards. 4 of them is created by <b>molding and casting</b> from the previous assignment. The rest two are also 3D printed. 

                The rest parts are all designed in Rhino. I also use <b>Grasshopper</b> to create gears. <br><br>

            <p>
                There are two biggest challenges in the design process: <br>
                The first one is creating the blades. The shapes with three teeth are very hard to generate in Rhino. So I used a couple of curves and jointed them together to make my first tooth. Then I duplicate the first tooth and rotate twice with 120 degrees and 240 degrees to create the second and the third blades. 
            </p>
            <img src="images/a8-bladeMaking.png" alt="" width="800">
            <p>
                The second one is to make all parts move together. I just need to make a hexagon-shaped hole at the center of each piece I want to rotate together; then, I use the hexagonal cylinder to "combine" them together.  <br>
            </p>
            <img src="images/a8-rotationShaftsSet.png" alt="" width="800">
            <p>
                One rotation shaft attaches the gear on its end. Another rotation shaft also includes one gear in the middle. With the help of the set of gears, the two rotation shafts could move at the same pace. I followed an YouTube Video to create my gear. Here is the link for that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnfvGDJF2l0&t=564s">Video</a>.<br>
                You can down my gear from <b><a href="images/a8-gear.zip">Here</a></b>
            </p>
            <img src="images/a8-gearMaking.png" alt="" width="800">
            <p>
                The rest of part is very relatively easy. In the whole process, I used the following techniques: <b>rhino</b>, <b>Grasshopper</b>, <b>3D Printing</b>, <b>Laser Cutting</b>, and <b>Molding</b>.
            </p>

            <h2>Revision</h2>
            <p>
                If you look back on the project proposal, there are no joints for the upper case and bottom case. After I printed them out, they would slide away when I was trying to move the handle. So I revised my model in Rhino and added the small hooks to make these two parts closely attached. 
            </p>
            <img src="images/A8-hookv1.png" alt="" width="800">
            <p>
                The result is not doing well. I lost my very first hook on peeling off the support. What is worse is when I press the upper case toward the bottom case, the hook is broken into two parts. As the image showm below. All hooks circled in red were broken when I was trying to press the upper part. 
            </p>
            <img src="images/a8-brokenhooks.JPG" alt="" width="800">
            <p>
                After consideration, I realized the upper case would only slide away to the left or right instead of forward or backward. Thus, I added a wall on the left and right sides of the bottom pieces.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another thing that comes to mind when writing this document is laser cutting an Acrylic board burns more materials on the edges than cutting normal cardboard. I laser cut five blades, and the diameter of the hexagonal hole is 1.2 mm bigger than what I have designed. As a result, the center rotation shaft is too small to make the blades move together. So as a solution, I created several cylinders attached to the shaft to increase its diameter.  
            </p>

            <h2>Bill of materials</h2>
            <p>
                I highly recommend 3D printing the whole project because there is uncertainly about laser cutting Acrylic boards. If you want to 3D print all materials, you need to prepare at least 403g filaments. The whole process would take more than two days to complete.
